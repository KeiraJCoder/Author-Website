    <h2>About the Author</h2>

    <p>You know that kid at school that has no friends and just reads all the time? Yeah. That was me.</p>

    <p>I started writing Memoirs of a Vampyr's Daughter when I was around 14 years of age, I am sure somewhere on an old hard-drive there still exists a copy of the original work (written in Microsoft Publisher don't you know!).</p>
    <p>I wrote book 1, Eden, almost in one sitting I believe, the stories of these characters just unfolded before me, as if they were already known to me. <br><br>When it was time for book 2 Wisdom to come along I wrote the first few chapters and then reached a dead end. I was stumped. Over time I would revisit the characters I loved so much, and TRY to write more of their stories, but I found myself stuck in a long dark tunnel with nowhere to go. Much like Aeryn and Mischa find themselves in.</p>
    <p>And ironically this was the part of the book that stumped me. I could see no way out. The story seemed to be going nowhere. And so I gave up.</p>

    <p>I published the first book with a company called AuthorCrossing (which has since disappeared from the real world) and it was full of mistakes, print errors, publication faults. It was terrible. 

        Only 10 of those books were ever printed.
    </p>
    <p>I remember the first time I actually held the book in my hand, I was residing in Australia and it was amazing, even with the terrible print edition</p>

    <p>Book 2 continued to be stalled. I had no way forward and so life continued. Sophie and her father continued to be stuck in limbo, Sophie waiting in that long dark passageway; and Eden, waiting in the room he thought the prophecy was held in, for years.</p>

    <p>Eventually, and as life has a habit of doing, time moved on and happiness and tragedy occured, I lost some wonderful people and I gained more, one in particular, but more about her later.</p>

    <p>Some events happened and I found myself stuck in an office job, where I was expected to scan documents all day long and imput them into a computer system. Needless to say this was boring work.</p>

    <p>At the funeral for someone you will all meet in book 3, I met this wonderful and talented writer, who has a Masters degree in Writing, as well as a bachelors.</p>

    <p>Her name was Frankie.</p>

    <p>She became my proof-reader, my editor and shortly afterwards; my girlfriend.</p>

    <p>So you can thank her for this series finally being completed, that desk job I hated turned into me writing for 6 hours a day, until book 2 and shortly book 3 were completed.</p>

    <p>And here we are now, an indie author with two books to her name. And a third in the pipeline.</p>

    <p>Thankyou to every single person who has given me their support over the years, to the people who have inspired characters stories, and names, and especially those of you who have ever bought one of the books.</p>

    <p>I couldn't have done it without you all.</p>
    
    <p>But especially you; Frankie</p>
